## Overview

The Honor Score System has been successfully implemented according to your structured and measurable approach. This comprehensive scoring system tracks user habit consistency and provides meaningful feedback through a 1000-point scale calculated twice monthly.

## âœ… Implementation Status

### Core Features Completed

1. **Daily Honor Impact**
   - âœ… Complete daily task â†’ +1 point (weighted by importance 1-5)
   - âœ… Miss daily task â†’ -1 point (with penalty cap of 3 consecutive misses)
   - âœ… Weighted tasks for nuanced scoring (Low=1, Medium=2, High=3, Urgent=4, Vital=5)

2. **Monthly Honor Score Adjustment**
   - âœ… Calculation every 15 days (twice monthly)
   - âœ… Period 1: 1st-15th of month
   - âœ… Period 2: 16th-end of month
   - âœ… Formula: (Raw Score Ã· Max Possible Points) Ã— 1000
   - âœ… Capped at 0-1000 points

3. **Enhanced Scoring Features**
   - âœ… Streak bonuses:
     - 5-day streak: +5 bonus points
     - 10-day streak: +15 bonus points
     - 15-day streak: +30 bonus points
   - âœ… Penalty caps: Maximum 3 consecutive misses to prevent excessive punishment
   - âœ… Task weight ranges: 1-5 for prioritizing important habits

4. **Database Implementation**
   - âœ… MongoDB schema with proper indexing
   - âœ… Daily habit logs with completion tracking
   - âœ… Honor Score historical records
   - âœ… User statistics integration

5. **Automated Calculations**
   - âœ… Scheduled cron jobs using node-cron
   - âœ… Automatic calculation on 1st and 16th of each month
   - âœ… Daily score updates for real-time tracking
   - âœ… Manual calculation triggers via API

6. **Visual Dashboard**
   - âœ… Interactive Honor Score dashboard
   - âœ… Visual summary table following your specification
   - âœ… Real-time progress tracking
   - âœ… Daily completion calendar view
   - âœ… Streak visualization and bonus tracking

## ðŸ“Š Visual Summary Implementation

The dashboard now includes the exact table format you specified:

| Interval | Achievements (Â±) | Raw Score | Scaled Honor Score | Extras |
|----------|------------------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Current Period | +12 / -3 | 9 | 600 | +Streak Bonus |
| Previous Period | â€” | â€” | Previous Score | Trend |

### Formula Breakdown Display
- **Raw Score:** Points Earned - Points Lost + Streak Bonuses
- **Honor Score:** (Raw Score Ã· Max Possible) Ã— 1000
- **Real-time updates** with color-coded performance indicators

## ðŸŽ¯ Example Calculation

### Scenario: 12 days completed, 3 missed in 15-day period

```
Raw Calculation:
- Points Earned: +12 (assuming weight 1)
- Points Lost: -3
- Streak Bonuses: +5 (5-day streak achieved)
- Raw Score: 12 - 3 + 5 = 14

Honor Score Calculation:
- Max Possible: 15 days Ã— 1 point = 15
- Honor Score: (14 Ã· 15) Ã— 1000 = 933

Result: 933/1000 (Excellent performance)
```
